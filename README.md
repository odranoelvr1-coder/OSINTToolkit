# OSINTToolkit
Educational security toolkit for learning OSINT, networking, and basic web security concepts. Includes non-intrusive information gathering, simple vulnerability checks, and utility tools. Built for experimentation, transparency, and ethical use only.

Hi 👋

This is a personal learning project built out of curiosity, boredom, and the classic
“I wonder how this works” moment.

I’m not a professional developer, not a pentesting god, and definitely not claiming this is a “powerful” tool.
It’s a collection of small utilities related to OSINT, networking, and basic web security concepts, made to learn by doing.

Expect:

messy code

rough edges

things that could be optimized

things that exist just because they were fun to implement

If you improve something: huge W.

What is this?

This toolkit includes:

OSINT-style information gathering tools

basic IP, domain, and website inspection

simple, non-intrusive vulnerability checks

small utilities (password generators, encoders, etc.)

Important:
This is NOT an exploitation framework.
It does NOT bypass authentication, crack accounts, deploy payloads, or weaponize vulnerabilities.

Everything is intentionally kept simple, transparent, and educational.

Philosophy

The goal is learning:

how networks behave

what public information exists

how basic security misconfigurations can be detected

how tools like this are structured internally

Nothing here is meant to be “plug-and-hack”.

VERY IMPORTANT — LEGAL & ETHICAL DISCLAIMER

This project is provided for educational purposes only.

DO NOT use this tool for:

illegal activities

malicious actions

harassment, stalking, or targeting people

scanning systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test

You are allowed to use this tool only on:

systems you own

systems you have been explicitly authorized to test

If you choose to ignore this:

that is entirely your responsibility

I take no responsibility for misuse, damages, bans, legal consequences, or poor life decisions

There are no exceptions and no excuses.

About “Vulnerability Scanning”

Any vulnerability checks included are:

superficial

non-intrusive

heuristic-based

meant to demonstrate concepts, not guarantee security

If this tool says:
“No vulnerabilities found”

it does NOT mean the target is secure.

Security is complex. This tool is not magic.

Transparency

No hidden payloads

No obfuscation

No automatic exploitation

Source code is fully readable

If you don’t trust it, open the .py file and read it.
That’s the whole point.

License

This project is open source and shared as-is.
Use it at your own risk.

A proper license is included to clarify usage and liability.

Contributions

Suggestions, improvements, refactors, and constructive feedback are welcome.

If you find bugs, congrats — you found part of the learning experience 🧠

Final Note

Learn things.
Break things you’re allowed to break.
Fix them.
Understand them.

And please…
don’t be that person.
